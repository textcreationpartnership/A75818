            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>A. More eſpecially of thoſe which more immediatly concern our coming to Gods Table, as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Of our knowledge, which is the eye of the ſoul to diſcern what we eat.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Of our faith, which is as the hand of the ſoul to receive Chriſt and all his merits as the chief nouriſhment of our ſouls.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Of our repentance which is as a ſallet of ſowre herbs to provoke our dul appetite to theſe heavenly dai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p n="6">6 Of our thankfulneſſe to the matter of the feaſt, who hath made us thus a feaſt of the fleſh and blood of his own and only ſon.</p>
                  <p>Q. Wherein conſiſts this examination of our ſelves concerning theſe?</p>
                  <p>A. According to the ſcriptures manner of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:116603:9"/>ſpeaking (which under words of knowledge comprehends affections and practiſe ſutable) it conſiſts in three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 In an impartial ſearch whether we have theſe graces of which is made up our wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding garment; which is a veſture of gold wrought about with divers colours, PSAL. 45.10. that is to ſay the garment of faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven with divers other graces, 1 PET. 1.7. COL. 1.3.12, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 If we find we have thoſe graces, then the ſecond thing is to prepare our ſelves; that is to ſay, to ſtir them up, and put them on as the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>de her ornaments againſt our coming; for it is not the bare having, but the having on our wedding garment that makes us welcome gueſts, MAT. 22.12. it is not the bare having of grace, but the preſent exerciſe thereof that makes us worthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. The Corinthians had all graces, 1 COR. 1.4, 5, 7. but<note n="(a)" place="margin">1 COR. 11.28.21.29.</note> becauſe they came not in the exerciſe of them (as of their love and godly fear) they were judged of God as unworthy receivers, as not diſcerning the Lords body, we muſt therefore quicken and revive our graces, before we come and ſo put on our wedding garment.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 If we fear we have not theſe graces,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:116603:9"/>then the third and laſt thing is to bewail our wants and to fly unto God and to beg them of him by hearty prayers, JAMES 1.5.</p>
                  <p>And finding our ſelves thus groaning under the ſenſe of our wants, and hungring and thirſting after Gods grace, we may boldly come; for Chriſt<note n="(c)" place="margin">MAT. 11.28.</note> cals all ſuch to come, and promiſes<note n="(d)" place="margin">MAT. 5.6.</note> they ſhal be filled.</p>
                  <p>Q. You ſaid we muſt alſo examine our ſelves concerning our ſins; of what ſins e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially muſt we examine our ſelves?</p>
                  <p>A. 1. Of ſcandalous ſins whereby we have not only offended God, and wounded our own ſouls, but alſo ſcandalized our brother; that is to ſay, grieved the ſtronger, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the weaker to ſin by our example.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of our wilful defects and decays in grace; ariſing either from our neglect of the means, or not uſing them ſo frequently and conſcionably as we ought, or not approving the occaſions of grace and our former expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience attained unto.</p>
                  <p>Q. Wherein conſiſts this examination of our ſins?</p>
                  <p>A. According to the former uſe of the Word it conſiſts</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In a careful and faithful ſearching out our ſins with all their aggravations, as with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116603:10"/>how high a hand we have offended; againſt what light we have ſinned; what offence to God and man we have incurred; and what wounds have followed on our own ſouls thereby.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In a diligent enquiry, how we ſtand af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to our ſins? As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether we judge our ſelves for them and grieve eſpecially that we have offended God, grieved his good ſpirit, ſcandalized our brethren, and wounded our own ſouls.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether we earneſtly deſire to be freed, not only from the puniſhment, but alſo from the power of ſin, and to be reconciled unto God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whether to this end, we fly unto Chriſt, that he may thus ſave us from our ſins, and make our peace with God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whether we reſolve fully with our ſelves to leave, by Gods grace, our ſins for the time to come, and to lead new lives; and to this end, to uſe all means appointed by God, and to uſe them frequently, and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably as we ought, and to improve all holy opportunities.</p>
                  <p>And they again who find it thus with them they may come with comfort; but as for thoſe who are neither troubled with the want of Gods grace, nor with the burden of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:116603:10"/>their ſins, and coming to Gods Table, have no ſenſe of what they come about; nor prepare their hearts to ſeek the Lord (2 CHRON. 30.18, 19.) ſuch cannot be but unworthy receivers: and ſo eat judgement to themſelves as not diſcerning the Lords body.</p>
